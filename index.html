                    language milestones lags behind typical developmental expectations. Children with language delays
                    may exhibit challenges in expressive language (spoken or written) or receptive language
                    (understanding spoken or written language). These delays can impact vocabulary growth, sentence
                    structure, and communication skills. Early identification and intervention, often involving
                    speech-language pathologists, are crucial to support the child in catching up to age-appropriate
                    language skills, promoting effective communication, and minimizing potential long-term impacts on
                    academic and social development.</span><br />

                    communication tactics and personalized activities that cater to the child's specific requirements.
                    This cooperative strategy ensures the creation of a nurturing home atmosphere that aligns with the
                    goals of structured therapy sessions. By incorporating parent coaching, the reinforcement of
                    communicative abilities is extended into diverse daily contexts, thereby augmenting the child's
